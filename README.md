```
Or
```bash
    python3 --version
```
    

- Windows: 
There is a .exe file which launch the project. But you can also use the .bat file which will install all the python dependencies and run the program.


- Linux:
The project contains a Anaconda environment file. You can install the virtual environement with th command :

```bash
  conda env create -f env.yml
```

And launch the project with :

```bash
  conda activate <env_name>
  python3 main.py
```

- Docker:
A docker file is also furnished with the project. Linux users can directly build the image with :

```bash
docker build -t <your-username>/RepositionX dockerfile
docker image ls
```

After the building you can run the docker with:

```bash
bash boot_docker.sh
```

Note that if you want to get back the ouput file of the program, you wille have to mount your output repository inside the docker. See the commented line inside boot_docker.
